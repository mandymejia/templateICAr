  > Please reduce the length of the title to less than 65 characters.

The new title is less than 65 characters.

  > Please add small executable examples in your Rd-files to illustrate the
use of the exported function but also enable automatic testing.

We added Rd examples for all major exported functions.

  > Please always add all authors, contributors and copyright holders in the 
  Authors@R field with the appropriate roles. From CRAN policies you agreed to:
  "Where copyrights are held by an entity other than the package authors,
  this should preferably be indicated via ‘cph’ roles in the ‘Authors@R’
  field, or using a ‘Copyright’ field (if necessary referring to an
  inst/COPYRIGHTS file)."
  e.g.: Martin Maechler, ETH Zurich
  Please explain in the submission comments what you did about this issue.

We added another person to Authors@R who helped write an older MATLAB version of the package. There are no further authors or copyright holders.
