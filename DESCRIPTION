Description: Implements the template ICA (independent components analysis) model
    proposed in Mejia et al. (2020) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2019.1679638> and the 
    spatial template ICA model proposed in proposed in Mejia et al. (2022)
    <doi:10.1080/10618600.2022.2104289>. Both models estimate subject-level 
    brain as deviations from known population-level networks, which are 
    estimated using standard ICA algorithms. Both models employ an 
    expectation-maximization algorithm for estimation of the latent brain 
    networks and unknown model parameters. Includes direct support for 'CIFTI',
    'GIFTI', and 'NIFTI' neuroimaging file formats.
