Description: Functions implementing the template ICA model proposed in Mejia et
    al. (2019) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2019.1679638> and the spatial template ICA
    model proposed in proposed in Mejia et al. (2020+). For both models, 
    subject-level brain networks are estimated as deviations from known 
    population-level networks, which can be estimated using standard ICA 
    algorithms. Both models employ an expectation-maximization algorithm 
    for estimation of the latent brain networks and unknown model parameters.
