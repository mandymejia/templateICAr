Description: This package contains functions implementing the template ICA model proposed in Mejia et al. (2019) 
    and the spatial template ICA model proposed in proposed in Mejia et al. (2020+). For both models, subject-level
    brain networks are estimated as deviations from known population-level networks, which can be estimated using
    standard ICA algorithms. Both models employ an expectation-maximization algorithm for estimation of the latent
    brain networks and unknown model parameters.
